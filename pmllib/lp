From Inverness follow the road signs for the A9 (Perth). Approximately 5 miles from Inverness on the left-hand side there is a sign for Daviot West, come off the A9 here and follow the road for about 3.5 miles until you come to a crossroads.
   
   Go straight over at the crossroads. 2.1 miles from the crossroads on the right hand side is Dunlichity House. If you get lost, follow the signs for the Wood Turner and we are 0.1 of a mile from the wood turners drive (with the woodturners drive on your left hand side). 
 Please come up the right hand side of the drive and come to the front door on the turret for access to the B&B (and not the adjacent self catering wing). 
 If you are coming from the south up the A9, leave the A9 at the sign for Daviot West and follow the directions given above.
